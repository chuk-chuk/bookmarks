## Bookmarks

#### User Stories

```
As a user, so I can access websites I find interesting,
I would like to see a list of websites I have bookmarked

As a user, so I can record new websites I find,
I would like to be able to add websites to my list of bookmarks

As a user, so I can categorise the websites I find,
I would like to add tags to my bookmarked sites

As a user, so I can filter websites by their theme,
I would like to access websites that only have specific tags

As a user, when I get bored with a website,
I would like to remove it from my list of bookmarks
